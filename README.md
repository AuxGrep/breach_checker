# About
"Breach checker" typically refers to a tool that helps individuals or organizations check whether their personal information or online accounts have been compromised in data breaches. Data breaches occur when unauthorized parties gain access to sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, email addresses, and more.

A breach checker works by allowing users to input their email addresses, usernames, or other identifying information. It then cross-references this information with databases of known data breaches. If a match is found, it indicates that the user's information has been part of a data breach.
